# 3D-flow-rig-for-decellularisation
STL Files for 3D printable flow rig for decullularisation of tissue.

The attached downloadable 3D printed flow rig, comprising the bioreactor chamber with an integrated reservoir, gasket, and chamber lid, utilises commercially available resins that are ISO 13485 and EU MDR certified, namely BioMed Clear Resin RS-F2-BMCL-01 (chamber and lid) and Elastic 50A Resin RS-F2-ELCL-01 (gasket). 

The three STL files for each component is included, in addition to the Autodesk Fusion 360 files. Apologies for the messy complete file, there was a lot of back and forth on the designs.

Note: The flow rig included below is an example design for the decellularisation of two conduits simultaneously, however the rig can be tailored to suit the specific application required. For example, dimensions can be altered using the freely available PreForm software (https://formlabs.com/uk/software/#preform) depending on the conduit size, and the design can be changed to decellularise a varying number of conduits in parallel. Ultimately, the requirement of the flow rig is to achieve consistent flow throughout the decellularisation process without leaks.
